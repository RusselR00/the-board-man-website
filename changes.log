## Critical Fixes & Updates - October 6, 2025

### üö® **Major Styling Issues Resolved**
**Problem:** Website components appeared unstyled despite proper code implementation  
**Root Cause:** TailwindCSS version mismatch - v4 installed with v3 configuration format  
**Solution Applied:**
1. **TailwindCSS Version Fix:** Downgraded from v4.1.14 to v3.4.18 for compatibility
2. **PostCSS Configuration:** Changed from `@tailwindcss/postcss` to `tailwindcss` plugin
3. **Component Updates:** Updated button component to latest shadcn/ui specifications
4. **Accessibility Fix:** Added SheetTitle with sr-only class for mobile menu accessibility

### üîß **Technical Updates:**
- **File Modified:** `postcss.config.js` - Fixed plugin configuration
- **File Modified:** `components/ui/button.tsx` - Updated to latest shadcn/ui implementation
- **File Modified:** `components/layout/header.tsx` - Added accessibility compliance
- **File Modified:** `package.json` - Corrected TailwindCSS version dependencies

### ‚úÖ **Results:**
- Website now displays professional modern design as intended
- All buttons, cards, and components properly styled
- Mobile menu accessibility compliance achieved
- Development server running stable at http://localhost:3000

### üìã **Lessons Learned:**
1. Always verify TailwindCSS version compatibility with configuration format

3. Accessibility requirements must be implemented from start (DialogTitle for Sheet components)
4. Browser testing essential to verify visual output matches code implementation
